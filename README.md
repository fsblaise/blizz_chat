# Blizz Chat
<i>This project is being developed for a university course, where we learn Flutter developement.</i>

This is a simple chat/social app with an elegant design, with authentication, where registered users can find themselves friends, chat with them, create stories, send pictures and find each other on the map. In the future I will add end-2-end encryption, to encrypt the messages before storing them in the database, therefore making it much more safer for users. 

## Technical details
The app is being developed using Flutter framework and the Dart language.<br>
For database it uses Google Firebase.<br>
In the future I will implement Signal's end-2-end encryption API.
